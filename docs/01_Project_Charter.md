# Customer Retention Analytics (Project Charter)
### Start Date: 11/2/2026
### Compeletion Date: 13/3/2026


## 1. Project Title
**Customer Retention Analytics for Contoso Omnichannel** 
## 2. Overview
This project develops a structured customer retention analytics framework for a multi-country retail business (Microsoft Contoso fictional dataset) using historical transaction data. The objective is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and identify high-value customers at-risk of churn (Descriptive Analytics Phase), predict future churn and customer lifetime value (Predictive Analytics Phase), and design data-driven strategies to improve retention and long-term profitability (Prescriptive Analytics Phase).
## 3. Business Problem Statement
The business does not have a clear and measurable way to identify high-value customers who are at risk of churn (no purchase within 160 days).
As a result, potential revenue loss is not detected early, marketing efforts are not precisely targeted, and retention resources may be misallocated.
The desired outcome is to reduce revenue loss by proactively identifying and managing high-value, at-risk of churn customers using a structured and measurable analytics framework.
## 4. Objective
Design and deliver, within 2 months, a complete customer retention analytics framework that identifies high-value at-risk customers (no purchase within 160 days), estimates churn probability and projects customer lifetime value over a 12-month forecasting horizon, and demonstrates at least a 10% projected improvement in retained revenue through simulated retention strategies.

## 5. Project Scope
### In Scope:
• Historical analysis (2015–20/04/2024) 

• RFM segmentation methodology

• Customer movement tracking

• Campaign simulation (2–3 structured campaigns)

• Synthetic future data generation

• Daily database updates

• Churn prediction (180-day definition)

• CLV prediction (12-month horizon)

• Business and ML interactive dashboards

### Out of Scope:
•	Supply chain, logistics, and inventory optimization analysis.
•	Pricing optimization
•	Deep neural networks
•	Real-world campaign execution or CRM system integration.
•	Real-time streaming architecture


## 6. Definitions, Assumptions & Risks
### Definitions:
• **Churned Customer:** No purchase within 180 days

• **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Total historical net profit generated by a customer (descriptive phase) and predicted net profit over a 12-month horizon (predictive phase).

• **Retention Optimization:** Focus on revenue-contributing customers

### Assumptions:
• Historical transaction data accurately reflects customer purchasing behavior.

• Retention interventions can influence future purchasing behavior.

• Past purchasing patterns contain predictive signals for future churn and value.

• No stock constraints impact purchasing behavior in the dataset.

### Risks:
• **Synthetic Bias:** Because the dataset and campaign simulations are fictitious, patterns learned by the models may not accurately reflect real-world customer behavior, limiting external validity.

• **Overfitting:** Models may perform very well on past data but fail to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

• **Metric Inflation:** Model performance or projected revenue improvements may appear artificially high due to controlled assumptions, simplified simulations, or lack of real-world noise.

• **Simulation Validity:** Retention strategy simulations may oversimplify real-world customer response behavior, reducing practical realism.



 
## 7. Deliverables & Success Criteria
### Deliverables:
1.	PostgreSQL Evolving Database: A production-ready schema containing historical data, campaign logs, and live daily updates.
2.	Predictive Modelling Pipelines: Churn and 12-month CLV Forecasting
3.	Campaign Simulation Engine: A logic-based script that applies marketing “treatments” and simulates customer responses.
4.	Model Performance Audit: A report comparing “Predicted vs Actual” results to prove the model’s reliability
5.	Jupiter Notebooks for the three types of Customer Retention Analytics (Descriptive, Predictive & Prescriptive).
6.	Interactive Executive dashboards (Updated Daily):
- Business Performance & Customer Behavior Analytics.
- Predictive Forecasts (The 12-month horizon).
- Campaign ROI (The lift generated by interventions).
7.	GitHub Documentation + ReadMe file
8.	Written Case Study in a presentation-style narrative

### Success Criteria:
• Clear and reproducible identification of high-value customers at-risk of churn.

• Customers’ category dynamically evolves over time based on the daily data generated.

• Data driven targeted campaigns produce realistic measurable impact.

• Predictive models meeting predefined performance thresholds (e.g., classification and regression evaluation metrics transparently reported).

• Dashboards support business decision making.

• Demonstrated projected improvement of at least 10% in retained revenue through simulated strategies.

• Logical consistency between descriptive insights, predictive outputs, and prescriptive recommendations.

• Comprehensive, well-structured, and professional documentation to facilitate the efficient execution of future similar projects.
