# PROJECT CHARTER (RFM ANALYTICS)
### 2/2026

## 1. Project Overview
### Project Name:
Contoso Omnichannel Value-Based Retention Analytics
### Project Type:
End-to-End Data Analytics & Machine Learning Simulation
### Primary Objective:
Maximize retention of high-revenue customers to achieve optimal ROI.
### Secondary Objectives:
•	Develop professional-grade data lifecycle workflow
•	Simulate realistic campaign execution and evaluation
•	Build and evaluate ML models (Churn & CLV)
•	Produce portfolio-ready documentation and presentation

## 2. Business Problem Statement
By the end of this quarter, develop a Predictive Retention System to identify and protect high-value revenue streams. The system will forecast individual customer spending for the next 12 months and calculate their likelihood of leaving, aiming to provide the insights necessary to reduce VIP churn by 10% through targeted, data-driven interventions.



 
## 3. Project Scope
### 1.	In Scope:
•	Historical analysis (2015–20/04/2024)
•	RFM segmentation
•	Customer movement tracking
•	Campaign simulation (2–3 structured campaigns)
•	Synthetic future data generation
•	Daily database updates
•	Churn prediction (180-day definition)
•	CLV prediction (12-month horizon)
•	Business and ML dashboards

### 2.	Out of Scope:
•	Supply chain constraints
•	Real-time streaming architecture
•	Deep neural networks


## 4. Success Criteria
The project is successful if:
•	Customer segments dynamically evolve over time
•	Campaigns produce measurable impact (including failures)
•	ML models are interpretable and realistically accurate
•	Dashboards reflect business decision-making
•	All assumptions are documented
•	Project workflow mirrors professional data teams

 
## 5. Key Definitions 
•	Churn: No purchase within 180 days
•	CLV Horizon: 12 months
•	Business Date Logic: Order Date
•	Retention Optimization: Focus on revenue-contributing customers

## 6. Risks & Controls
| Risk | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Synthetic bias | Explicit probabilistic modeling |
| Overfitting to generated data | Freeze generator during evaluation windows |
| Metric inflation | Document assumptions before modeling |
| Scope creep | Use GitHub project board strictly |


 
## 7. Deliverables
1-	PostgreSQL Evolving Database:
A production-ready schema containing historical sales, campaign logs, and live daily updates

2-	Predictive Modeling Pipelines:
Churn Probability and 12-month CLV Forecasting

3-	Campaign Simulation Engine: 
A logic-based script that applies marketing "treatments" and simulates customer responses

4-	Model Performance Audit:
A report/notebook comparing "Predicted vs. Actual" results to prove the model's reliability

5-	Interactive Executive dashboards (Updated Daily):
- Historical Performance (The past).
- Predictive Forecasts (The 12-month horizon).
- Campaign ROI (The lift generated by interventions).

6-	GitHub documentation

7-	Written case study

8-	Presentation-style narrative
